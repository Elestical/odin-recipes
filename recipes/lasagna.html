    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made in very wide, flat sheets.<p>
    </p> The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.</p>
